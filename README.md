# Repo for Max's Bannerlord Mod

### My gripes with Bannerlord

Bannerlord's enjoyment curve is logarithmic. That is to say it is extremely fun in the early game, but once you hit mid game it levels out fast. You already likely have an army mostly comprised of T6 troops, and you just slog through castle after town after castle because the only progression is horizontal. Building up towns is hardly worth it other than for the roleplay aspect, and elite troops are easy to come by and die fast and often.

The mid-late game has always been Bannerlord's weak spot. Sure you can increase the difficulty by making your troops weaker, or choose not to fill your army with Khan's Guards, but that just makes the game artifically harder with no real reward.

I think this can be fixed by increasing the ceiling and making it more rewarding. T6 troops should be *hard* to get, but are also extremely powerful. Arming out companions is *worth* the investment because they can only get wounded. Towns and villages can become *extremely* prosperous if you invest and protect them. Once you can afford the expensive T6 armors, you should feel powerful and almost immune to lower tier troops. You should be able to have fun being a vassal, rather than just feeling pressured to take 5+ towns just to support your army. 


### Goals of this mod
 1. Make Elite T5 & T6 troops truly Elite, especially for Noble troop trees
    - More specifically, something like a Khuzait Khan's Guard or Imperial Cataphract should be extremely hard to kill and protected from damage from lower tier troops.
    - In addition, I think Khan's Guard should have their weapons downtiered. Maybe a 2h sword or sword/shield, but glaives on horses are just too OP
    - In the future, I would like to give each faction another noble troop tree line. Only have 1 per faction was stupid and lazy, not too mention how lazy the actual troop design was.
 2. Make armor more meaningful
    - Right now, armor doesn't give you much protection at all. A recruit with a sword can deal significant damage to a heavily armored player or NPC.
    - This goes hand in hand with point 1, because a T6 400k denar chestplate shouldn't just give 2x the protection of a T4 10k chestplate (turning a 1 hit kill to 2 hits from low tier troops), it should be much higher. Initial testing shows me that T6 armors should have their armor values doubled, and similarly for T5 (and for all armors worn by T6 units).

 3. Higher Tier troops should cost exponentially more to upgrade
    - How does it make sense that you hand a Kheshig 150 denars and he goes out and buys 600k denars+ worth of equipment? Not only should T6 cav perform like they cost an arm and a leg, they should also actually cost an arm and a leg. Right now, I'm thinking of increasing the cost to be somewhere in the realm of 4k to upgrade to T5, and 10k to T6.

 4. Villages and towns should give more money, but only when upgraded and protected.
    - Right now, the best way to increase income is to conquer more territory. Town building is a chore at best, and gives minimal rewards. I'm not sure how the village income is decided in the game, but for towns I am thinking of increasing the toll collector building bonuses from +5/10/15% to something like 50/100/200, but making it take a lot more time. Alternatively, making every construction project contribute 5-10%.

There are probably more things I will add, but those are my main gripes with the game.
